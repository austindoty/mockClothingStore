# Mock Clothing Store

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## General Overview
This repo is home to Crwn Clothing, a mock clothing store app that is able to accept payment for clothing through Stripe API. Users can sign in with google sign-in or email based sign in. All data is stored in google Firebase-Firestore. I was a assest folder and built the project up from there. 

### Learning Objectives
  1. Build a E-Commerce Website with React
  2. Use Stripe API to collect payment info
  3. Use Redux to understand state mangemenet outside of react useState.
  4. Use a cloud data storage, Google Firestore, to step into the Cloud Storage sector.

## What I Learned

I was able to show myself I can learn new tools from reading documentation and asking the right questions. I was proud of my accomplishment with both connecting to the Google Firebase/Firestore and implementing the Stripe API and Stripe Js to effectivly collect card data and payment. I now understand in a greater capacity the full life cycle of a project and also that projects are also on going and never quite end. I have ambitious goals for the project, but at the end of the day. I learned various tools, and now desire to build more projects that could have better UI/UX.
